### Layouts
#### Participant Layout
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
This is a simple layout for participants. When you open the sidebar, the components on the left will squeeze in to get the sidebar the required space.

#### Interpreter Layout
Open [http://localhost:3000/interpreter](http://localhost:3000/interpreter) to view it in the browser.
This is a simple layout for interpreters. There are two extra boxes for relay for interpreters. When you open the sidebar, the components on the left will squeeze in to get the sidebar the required space but the relay will not shrink.
